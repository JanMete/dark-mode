This app will check user system theme setting and set it as the default. When user will change theme it will be updated in local storage. I used NextUI library for theme switch component and react scroll for scroll functionality.
For styling I used tailwind css and it's darkmode feature for practice.

Also in this project I used TypeScript that I learned from "Understanding TypeScript" course created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/#instructor-1

Libs: vite, typescript, tailwind, prettier-plugin-tailwindcss, react-scroll
